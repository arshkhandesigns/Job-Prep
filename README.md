# 👋 Hi there! Welcome to my GitHub

I'm currently focused on improving my programming skills through consistent learning and practice. Here's what I'm working on:

## 🚀 Current Goals

- 🔁 **100 Days of Code Challenge**  
  I'm actively participating in the #100DaysOfCode challenge, mainly using **Java** to improve my coding and problem-solving skills.

- 🌐 **Web Development Journey**  
  Alongside Java, I'm learning **Web Development** — including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more.  
  I regularly upload my progress and projects here on GitHub.

## 📂 Repositories to Check Out

- 💻 Java practice projects and code
- 🧑‍💻 Web development projects and learning exercises

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue learning and building!
